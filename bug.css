The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly, especially when combining different units (like `px` and `%`). For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected if the parent container's width changes dynamically.  Another issue can occur when nesting `calc()` functions.  Overly complex nested `calc()` expressions can become difficult to read and debug.  Finally, issues can arise with browser compatibility, where older or less common browsers may not support `calc()` or may interpret it differently.
